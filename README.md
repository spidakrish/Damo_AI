# DayleSeaChat - Customized RAG Chatbot

## Overview
DayleSeaChat is a custom-built, self-hosted conversational AI solution designed specifically for Daylor Engineering's maritime services website. The chatbot leverages a fine-tuned DeepSeek model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, contextual responses about Daylor's services, technical specifications, and maritime engineering expertise.
